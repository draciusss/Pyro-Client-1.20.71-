This base is really shit and contains a lot of shit code as a result of being me, Shane, and Anshul's first C++ project. Thank you for everyone who has joined me and my friends on this journey, it has been great! Maybe the readme will be updated in the future. Pull requests are welcomed.

Make sure to read the license terms before modifying or distributing, though i don't really care, shame on you if you skid from this shitass base

Building the DLL should be easy. Just clone, set up your IDE and make sure you have the necessary tools ready to build with CMAKE, watch a tutorial or two if you don't know and there you have it. In theory, debug and release builds both should work.
